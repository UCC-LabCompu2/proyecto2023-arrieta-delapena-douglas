            <h4>Verse 1</h4>
            <pre>
            C
            I never knew
            Em              G             C
            I never knew that everything was falling through
            Em        G               C
            That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
            Em       G               Am   Em        D
            To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
            C
            But that's how it's got to be
            Em              G               C
            It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
            Em             G              C
            I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
            Em        G           Am      Em        D
            The smoke and who's still standing when it clears
        </pre>
            <h4>Chorus</h4>
        <pre>
            C    G    Em        G
            Everyone knows I'm in
            C        G     Em      D
            Over my head, over my head
            C    G              Em     G
            With eight seconds left in overtime
            C        G          Em   D    C
            She's on your mind, she's on your mind

            Em  G  C
            Em  G
        </pre>
                <h4>Verse 2</h4>
        <pre>
            C
            Let's rearrange
            Em              G                C
            I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
            Em           G              C
            To say that we agree and then never change
            Em   G            Am        Em    D
            Soften a bit until we all just get along
            C
            But that's disregard
            Em           G              C
            You find another friend and you discard
            Em          G          C
            As you lose the argument in a cable car
            Em   G            Am    Em     D
            Hanging above as the canyon comes between
        </pre>
                <h4>Chorus</h4>
        <pre>
            C    G    Em        G
            Everyone knows I'm in
            C        G     Em      D
            Over my head, over my head
            C    G              Em     G
            With eight seconds left in overtime
            C        G          Em       D
            She's on your mind, she's on your mind

            C    G    Em        G
            Everyone knows I'm in
            C        G     Em      D
            Over my head, over my head
            C    G              Em     G
            With eight seconds left in overtime
            C        G          Em  D
            She's on your mind, she's on, oh
        </pre>
                <h4>Bridge 1</h4>
        <pre>
            C          Em       G           C
            And suddenly I become a part of your past
            Em          G              C
            I'm becoming the part that don't last
            Em    G             Am
            I'm losing you and it's effortless
        </pre>
                <h4>Verse 3</h4>
        <pre>
            C                        Em            G
            Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
            C
            In the throw around
            Em              G         C
            Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
            Em         G            Am
            I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves
        </pre>
                <h4>Bridge 2</h4>
        <pre>
            G         G/F#
            Everyone knows I'm in
            Em7             C
            Over my head, over my head
            C    G              Em   G
            With eight seconds left in overtime
            Am       G          Em  D    C      Em
            She's on your mind, she's on your mind...

            Everyone knows...   she's on your mind...
            Em                 G         C
            Everyone knows I'm in over my head
